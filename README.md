Number to Words Code Kata
=========================

The Kata
--------

For a given integer return the number in words.

Initial focus is on implementing support for any positive integer up to 9999.

So 1234 becomes "one thousand two hundred and thirty four".

My implementation
-----------------
This is a personal implementation of the number to words code kata.

It is also a test of applying TPP as strictly as I can as I work.

The commits attempt to track how many TPP points Im accumulating as I code, but even as I code Im becoming aware of just how little I'm consciously aware of the Priority cost of some of my decisions even though Im attempting to focus on it.
